cache-js
=====================

A javascript module to cache json data (or any data) using a Web SQL database.

Usage
=====================
cache.get(url, callback, options);

Options
=====================
params- default: ""- these are the params that are passed with the ajax call

page- default: 1- this is an optional way to distinguish identical urls, if you want to cache multiple "pages" of data from the same url

type- default: ""- this is an optional way to distinguish identical urls, if you want to cache multiple times from the same url

offline- default: false- whether or not you're online (or whether or not you want to try to get the data from online)

fallback- default: true- whether or not you want to get data from the local database if the online ajax call fails

save- default: true- whether or not you want to cache the data to the local database

ajaxType- default: 'POST'- type of ajax call to make (either 'GET' or 'POST')

Example Usage
=====================

    cache.get(
      myUrl,
      function(results) {
        // Do whatever
      },
      {
      	params: "fname=Bob&lname=Smith",
        page: 1,
        offline: false,
        fallback: true,
        save: true,
        ajaxType: 'POST'
      }
    );

Example with json parameters:

    cache.get(
      myUrl,
      function(results) {
        // Do whatever
      },
      {
        params: {'fname': 'Bob', 'lname': 'Smith'}
      }
    );

Dependencies
=====================
It does require jquery for the ajax call, but if anyone wants to contribute in order to remove that dependency, that would be great.
